                <p>The ability to understand and prioritize risks effectively can mean the difference between resilience and vulnerability. This case study examines a Fortune 500 international food chain with over 100,000 employees and how Cyclops's AI-powered platform uncovered critical security risks that had gone unnoticed.</p>

                <h2>The Blind Men and the Elephant</h2>
                <p>The ancient parable of "The Blind Men and the Elephant" perfectly illustrates the challenge facing modern SecOps teams. Each blind man touches a different part of the elephant and draws completely different conclusions about what they're encountering. Similarly, fragmented security alerts prevent teams from seeing the complete picture of their security posture.</p>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Despite having multiple security tools in place, the organization struggled to correlate data across systems and identify relationships between seemingly unrelated security events. Each tool provided its own view, but no single solution could connect the dots.</p>

                <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <p>Using Cyclops's AI-powered platform, the security team uncovered several critical issues:</p>

                <h3>Critical Systems Without Protection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Several critical systems were missing required security protections</li>
                    <li>Two company executives had privileged access to these critical systems</li>
                    <li>These executives were accessing critical systems without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
                    <li>Some identities, including executives, had failed phishing simulations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Additional Discoveries</h3>
                <p>Beyond the immediate critical risks, the platform also identified:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unmanaged devices in the environment</li>
                    <li>IT hygiene issues like inactive devices and unknown software</li>
                    <li>Additional security solutions not initially connected to the platform</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Impact</h2>
                <p>By automatically correlating and analyzing security data across multiple systems, Cyclops revealed hidden risks that could have led to a significant security incident. The platform provided a holistic view of the organization's security landscape, enabling the SecOps team to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats</li>
                    <li>Understand the relationships between users, assets, and vulnerabilities</li>
                    <li>Prioritize remediation efforts based on actual business risk</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Just as the blind men needed to share their perspectives to understand the elephant, security teams need a platform that can correlate data across all their tools to see the complete security picture. Cyclops's AI-powered approach transforms fragmented alerts into actionable intelligence, helping organizations prevent security incidents before they occur.</p>
