                <p>Much of today's cybersecurity approach still feels like firefighting—juggling alerts, scrambling for context, and trying to understand which assets are truly at risk. Traditional Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM) tools focus on asset inventory without understanding security impact, taking a reactive approach to cybersecurity while lacking contextual intelligence.</p>

                <h2>Traditional CAASM Tools' Shortcomings</h2>
                <p>Traditional CAASM solutions provide visibility into what assets exist, but they fall short in helping security teams understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which assets are at risk</li>
                    <li>Why they're at risk</li>
                    <li>What the business impact would be</li>
                    <li>How to prioritize remediation efforts</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Cyclops Security's Solution: The Security Fabric</h2>
                <p>Cyclops Security introduces a new approach through its Security Fabric, which transforms how organizations manage and understand their security posture.</p>

                <h3>Three Key Strategies:</h3>

                <h4>1. Prioritize Risks</h4>
                <p>Use the "exposure graph" to identify critical vulnerabilities, reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and investigate (MTTI), and focus on high-impact threats that truly matter to your business.</p>

                <h4>2. Avoid Regulatory Penalties</h4>
                <p>Map security and compliance control gaps across your infrastructure. Identify missing protections and correlate control gaps to prevent compliance risks before they become costly penalties.</p>

                <h4>3. Enhanced Asset Management</h4>
                <p>Tag and monitor high-risk assets, deduplicate alerts to reduce noise, and streamline threat response with contextual intelligence.</p>

                <h2>The Key Difference</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Knowing about your assets isn't enough—you need to understand which assets are at risk, why, and how to address them before they become security incidents."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Cyclops Security bridges the gap between asset visibility and actionable security intelligence, enabling organizations to move from reactive firefighting to proactive risk management.</p>
